# About Me

I am 27 years old, I work in the field of logistics in an electronics warehouse. For 5 years of work here, I realized that I am not developing as a specialist, and I need a job that will bring not only money, but first of all will be interesting as the main occupation in life.
My strengths are a quick search for solutions to problems, a love of study and self-development, perseverance.
I want to get the skills and knowledge necessary for a developer, with which I can get a new job and develop further.
